you can also do rollback commands like:  
`kubectl rollout undo deploy test`

<span style="color:red">However, <strong>this is bad as now declaritely you have nginix:14 and present state is nginix:1.13; so it's best to keep with deploy.yml.</strong>  
The rollback is an imperative operation, so out of sync with yml file.</span>
